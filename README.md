## 🎭 About This Masterpiece

Behold, mere mortals! You've stumbled upon the most groundbreaking, earth-shattering, mind-bogglingly average C++ project in the history of computing. Prepare to be whelmed!

## 🚀 Features

- Segmentation faults (now with 50% more segmentation!)
- Memory leaks (because who doesn't love a good leak?)
- Undefined behavior (keeping you on your toes since 1979)
- Cryptic error messages (fluency in ancient Sumerian recommended)

## 🛠 Installation

1. Sacrifice a rubber duck to the C++ gods
2. Chant "iostream" three times while standing on one foot
3. Run `g++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++17 -O3 main.cpp -o program_that_might_work`
4. Cross your fingers and hope for the best

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Program

```bash
./program_that_might_work
```

If it crashes, congratulations! You're now a true C++ developer.

## 🐛 Debugging

1. Stare at the code until your eyes bleed
2. Add 100 more `cout` statements
3. Recompile and watch it fail in a completely different way
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until retirement or mental breakdown (whichever comes first)

## 🤝 Contributing

Remember, in C++, we don't make mistakes. We have "happy little undefined behaviors." 🎨
